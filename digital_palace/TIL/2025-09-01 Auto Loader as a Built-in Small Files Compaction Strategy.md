## 🎯 Problem / Context  
When ingesting data from external providers (often via **Kafka Connect → cloud storage**), you can end up with **millions of tiny JSON files**.  
This creates a bottleneck:  
- A plain `spark.read.load()` on the raw bucket can take **hours or fail completely**.  
- Traditional ETL needs custom jobs to merge and repartition files before the data becomes usable.  

In practice, when suppliers control Kafka Connect configs, you can’t enforce proper batching. This means the raw zone (bronze) fills up with millions of micro-files. Without downstream compaction, Bronze becomes unusable — which **jeopardizes the medallion architecture itself**. If Bronze is unreadable, the Silver/Gold layers cannot exist in practice.  

## 🐛 Common Pitfall  
A naïve setup assumes you can always “just read everything in batch.” In reality:  
- Listing & opening millions of files dominates runtime.  
- Even if ingestion succeeds, downstream queries run on **fragmented partitions** and degrade fast.  
- Manually coding compaction jobs adds operational overhead and fragility.  

## 💡 Solution / Snippet  
Databricks **Auto Loader** solves this with an **incremental ingestion + auto-compaction** pattern:  

```
# Bronze ingestion with Auto Loader
df = (spark.readStream
  .format("cloudFiles")
  .option("cloudFiles.format", "json")
  .option("cloudFiles.inferColumnTypes", "true")
  .load("s3://vendor-drop/topic-x/"))

(df.writeStream
  .option("checkpointLocation", "dbfs:/chk/bronze_raw")
  .toTable("lake.bronze_raw"))

# Table settings to enable auto-compaction
spark.sql("""
ALTER TABLE lake.bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  'delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true',
  'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact'   = 'true'
)""")
```

👉 This can be used in two ways:  
- **One-shot ingestion**: if you manage to change producer configs (or reprocess legacy data), Auto Loader will still compact everything during load.  
- **Continuous ingestion**: if changing the upstream is impossible, you let Auto Loader process each new file as it lands, with `autoCompact` keeping the table clean.  

This way:  
- **Auto Loader batches or streams** the raw files incrementally (no need for `spark.read.load()` on millions of files).  
- **Delta auto-optimize** merges tiny output files into large, query-friendly parquet chunks.  
- You can schedule further `OPTIMIZE` jobs or run a stream-to-stream compaction (bronze_raw → bronze_compacted) if needed.  

## 🔍 Why It Works  
- Auto Loader leverages **incremental file discovery** (notification services or efficient listing).  
- Instead of producing one file per input, **optimized writes** coalesce into larger parquet files.  
- Compaction is “continuous”: you don’t wait for a massive batch job to catch up.  
- Downstream (silver/gold) layers consume already-compacted bronze, avoiding the small-files trap.  

## 🛠️ When to Use It  
- Vendors push data via **Kafka Connect → cloud object store**, and you can’t tune their batching.  
- Sources generate **high-frequency micro-files** (IoT, logs, JSON events).  
- You want to **replace Spark batch loads** (too heavy) with incremental ingestion.  

### ✅ Before  
- Raw zone with millions of JSONs.  
- Reading required hours of metadata operations.  
- Manual compaction jobs added latency & cost.  

### ✅ With This Solution  
- Auto Loader streams/batches incrementally.  
- Delta auto-optimize compacts transparently.  
- Only one ingestion pipeline to maintain, ready for CI/CD deployment.  

## 🧠 Key Ideas to Remember  
- Auto Loader ≠ just streaming: it’s a **file ingestion service with compaction built-in**.  
- `delta.autoOptimize.*` saves you from writing custom “small files compaction” jobs.  
- For heavy pipelines, add **scheduled OPTIMIZE / Z-ORDER** to keep query performance high.
