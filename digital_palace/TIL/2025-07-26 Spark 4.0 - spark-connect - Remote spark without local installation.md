## ðŸŽ¯ Problem / Context  
> I wanted to use Spark in microservices, notebooks, or lightweight data apps **without installing Spark** locally or spinning up full EMR clusters for basic read-transform-write tasks.

Spark used to require Spark to be locally installed or run in-cluster. That meant managing heavyweight deployments (e.g. `spark-submit`, EMR, Docker images with full Spark runtime).
