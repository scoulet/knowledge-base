## 🎯 Problem / Context  
I once had a user complaining about **missing rows in Silver data**. These rows were critical for their application — in this case, billing (!).  
Upstream, the data producer was dumping everything through **Kafka Connect → Bronze**. To debug whether the issue came from the producer or from our ELT, we had to check the Bronze zone.  

But here’s the catch:  
- Bronze contained **terabytes split across millions of tiny files**, poorly partitioned.  
- To answer a simple question (“is this row in Bronze?”), we had to run a massive `spark.read.load()`.  
- Often it was **so heavy it wouldn’t finish at all**.  

This meant we couldn’t even tell if the **producer was at fault** or if the **pipeline had dropped data** — putting at risk both user trust and the **medallion architecture itself**. If Bronze is unreadable, the whole Bronze → Silver → Gold flow collapses.  

In practice, when suppliers control Kafka Connect configs, you can’t enforce proper batching. This means the raw zone (bronze) fills up with millions of micro-files. Without downstream compaction, Bronze becomes unusable.  

## 🐛 Common Pitfall  
A naïve setup assumes you can always “just read everything in batch.” In reality:  
- Listing & opening millions of files dominates runtime.  
- Even if ingestion succeeds, downstream queries run on **fragmented partitions** and degrade fast.  
- Manually coding compaction jobs adds operational overhead and fragility.  

## 💡 Solution / Snippet  
Databricks **Auto Loader** solves this with an **incremental ingestion + auto-compaction** pattern:  

```
# Bronze ingestion with Auto Loader
df = (spark.readStream
  .format("cloudFiles")
  .option("cloudFiles.format", "json")
  .option("cloudFiles.inferColumnTypes", "true")
  .load("s3://vendor-drop/topic-x/"))

(df.writeStream
  .option("checkpointLocation", "dbfs:/chk/bronze_raw")
  .toTable("lake.bronze_raw"))

# Table settings to enable auto-compaction
spark.sql("""
ALTER TABLE lake.bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  'delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true',
  'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact'   = 'true'
)""")
```

👉 This can be used in two ways:  
- **One-shot ingestion**: if you manage to change producer configs (or reprocess legacy data), Auto Loader will still compact everything during load.  
- **Continuous ingestion**: if changing the upstream is impossible, you let Auto Loader process each new file as it lands, with `autoCompact` keeping the table clean.  

This way:  
- **Auto Loader batches or streams** the raw files incrementally (no need for `spark.read.load()` on millions of files).  
- **Delta auto-optimize** merges tiny output files into large, query-friendly parquet chunks.  
- You can schedule further `OPTIMIZE` jobs or run a stream-to-stream compaction (bronze_raw → bronze_compacted) if needed.  

## 🔍 Why It Works  
- Auto Loader leverages **incremental file discovery** (notification services or efficient listing).  
- Instead of producing one file per input, **optimized writes** coalesce into larger parquet files.  
- Compaction is “continuous”: you don’t wait for a massive batch job to catch up.  
- Downstream (silver/gold) layers consume already-compacted bronze, avoiding the small-files trap. 
- Auto Loader also maintains a **checkpoint of processed files**, ensuring that no file is missed and none is ingested twice. This reliability is critical when dealing with millions of incoming micro-files from uncontrolled producers.

## 🛠️ When to Use It  
- Vendors push data via **Kafka Connect → cloud object store**, and you can’t tune their batching.  
- Sources generate **high-frequency micro-files** (IoT, logs, JSON events).  
- You want to **replace Spark batch loads** (too heavy) with incremental ingestion.  

### ✅ Before  
- Raw zone with millions of JSONs.  
- Reading required hours of metadata operations.  
- Manual compaction jobs added latency & cost.  

### ✅ With This Solution  
- Auto Loader streams/batches incrementally.  
- Delta auto-optimize compacts transparently.  
- Only one ingestion pipeline to maintain, ready for CI/CD deployment.  

## 🧠 Key Ideas to Remember  
- Auto Loader ≠ just streaming: it’s a **file ingestion service with compaction built-in**.  
- `delta.autoOptimize.*` saves you from writing custom “small files compaction” jobs.  
- For heavy pipelines, add **scheduled OPTIMIZE / Z-ORDER** to keep query performance high.
