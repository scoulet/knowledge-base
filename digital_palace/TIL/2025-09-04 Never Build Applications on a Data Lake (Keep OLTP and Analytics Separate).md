## 🎯 Problem / Context  
Some teams try to power **application logic** (e.g., tracking clicks in a mobile app) directly from a **data lake**. The pattern looks like this: events → S3 (Parquet) → batch jobs → analytics tables.  

It feels attractive (“one central store for everything”), but in practice it’s a terrible idea:  
- High **latency** (updates arrive hours later).  
- No **transaction guarantees** (files may be missing, duplicated, or corrupted).  
- Poor **user experience** (real-time counters or leaderboards lag behind).  
- **Operational risk** (systems break when apps depend on an analytical pipeline).  

A data lake is built for **analytics**, not for **transactional application logic**.  

## 🐛 Common Pitfall  
Treating the data lake as the **single source of truth** for both apps and analytics.  
This inevitably turns into a “data swamp” full of slow queries, governance gaps, and users wondering why their click didn’t update right away.  

## 💡 Solution / Snippet  
Separate **real-time app logic** from **analytics**.  

```
# Real-time path (application logic)
API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB  

# Analytics path (reporting)
DynamoDB Streams -> Kinesis Firehose -> S3 (Parquet) -> Athena
```

DynamoDB provides the low-latency, transactional source of truth.  
The lake (S3 + Athena) handles **aggregates and historical analysis**.  

## 🔍 Why It Works  
- **Separation of concerns**: OLTP (apps) vs OLAP (analytics).  
- **Low latency**: DynamoDB updates in milliseconds.  
- **Scalability**: both paths scale independently.  
- **Auditability**: events flow downstream to the lake for replay and reporting.  

## 🛠️ When to Use It  
- Tracking clicks, likes, views in mobile or web apps.  
- Feature flags or user preferences.  
- Quotas, limits, fraud detection signals.  

### ✅ Before (App on Data Lake)  
- Click → S3 file → batch aggregation → table refresh.  
- Latency: minutes to hours.  
- No transactional guarantees.  
- Data swamp risk.  

### ✅ After (App + Analytics Separation)  
- Click → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB (real-time source of truth).  
- DynamoDB Streams replicate events into S3 for analytics.  
- Apps are fast and reliable; analysts still get their lake.  

## 🧠 Key Ideas to Remember  
- **Never build application logic on a data lake**.  
- **Always separate OLTP (apps) and OLAP (analytics)**.  
- Use event streaming (DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis) to bridge the two worlds.
