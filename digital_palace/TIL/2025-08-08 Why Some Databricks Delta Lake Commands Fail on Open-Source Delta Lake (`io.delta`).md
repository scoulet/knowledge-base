## üéØ Problem / Context  
Delta Lake exists in two worlds:
- **Databricks Delta Lake** ‚Üí tightly integrated with the Databricks Runtime (DBR), Photon, and platform-level optimizations.
- **Open-Source Delta Lake (`io.delta`)** ‚Üí a standalone library usable with any Spark environment (e.g., EMR, local Spark).

While both share the same core transaction log format, **many Databricks-only commands and features don‚Äôt exist in OSS** or are only partially implemented.  
Trying to run these features in OSS environments (like AWS EMR) can result in:
- No-ops (command runs but has no effect).
- Poor performance.
- Runtime errors.

## üêõ Common Pitfall  
Assuming you can run Databricks-only commands such as `OPTIMIZE` (with Z-Ordering or Liquid Clustering) or `VACUUM` with custom retention on an OSS Delta table.  
In practice, this often leads to:
- Failures due to unsupported operations.
- Extremely slow execution because platform-level hooks are missing.
- Confusion when results differ from Databricks.

## üí° Solution / Snippet  
### Known differences and breakages

#### 1. `VACUUM` on EMR (OSS Delta)
- **Observed issue**: Running `VACUUM(24)` on OSS Delta tables stored in S3 can be extremely slow, with long idle periods and sporadic job activity.  
- **Cause**: Lack of Databricks‚Äô runtime-level optimizations (parallelized metadata scanning, storage API hooks).
- **Databricks behavior**: Faster execution, retention < 7 days allowed (with config), integrated monitoring.

#### 2. `OPTIMIZE` with Liquid Clustering
- **Observed issue**: Command fails with `executeCompaction()` when using Liquid Clustering in OSS Delta.  
- **Cause**: Liquid Clustering is Databricks-only; OSS has no implementation of its compaction logic.
- **Databricks behavior**: Fully supported with background compaction.

#### 3. Z-Ordering
- **Observed issue**: `ZORDER BY` syntax not recognized in OSS Delta ‚Äî no parser or optimizer rules for it.
- **Cause**: Feature is implemented in Databricks‚Äô optimizer layer, not in OSS Spark SQL.

#### 4. Advanced Features Not Available in OSS  
| Feature                                | OSS Delta Support                          | Databricks Delta Support                     |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Deletion Vectors (DV)**              | Partial since v3.1 (read/update limited)    | Full support (DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE at scale) |
| **Change Data Feed (CDF)**             | Absent or partial experimental APIs         | Full integration, with incremental reads      |
| **Liquid Clustering**                  | Not available                               | Available, integrated with OPTIMIZE           |
| **Generated Columns**                   | Not enforced                                | Enforced at write time                        |
| **Table Constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL)**| Not enforced                                | Enforced at write time                        |
| **Automatic File Compaction**          | Manual implementation required              | Automatic & runtime-optimized                 |
| **Retention < 7 days in VACUUM**        | Requires manual override, riskier           | Configurable & safe                           |
| **Optimize Write** (bin-packing)       | Manual partition/repartition needed         | Automatic when enabled                        |

## üîç Why It Works (or Fails)  
- Databricks‚Äô Delta Lake is **not just the library** ‚Äî it‚Äôs deeply integrated into the runtime, planner, and storage layer.
- Commands like `OPTIMIZE` rely on:
  - Planner rules in the Databricks Runtime.
  - Platform-specific optimizations for file listing, metadata caching, and parallel I/O.
- OSS Delta only implements the **core transaction protocol** and basic operations (`MERGE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `VACUUM`), without these platform hooks.

## üõ†Ô∏è When to Use It  
- OSS Delta: For environments without Databricks (e.g., EMR, on-prem Spark) where you only need the ACID table format and basic commands.
- Databricks Delta: When you need advanced optimizations, governance features, or large-scale maintenance commands.

### ‚úÖ Before  
- Writing Databricks-style commands in EMR and expecting identical behavior.  
- Using unsupported features (Liquid Clustering, Z-Order, CDF, DV) in OSS ‚Üí runtime errors.  
- Poor performance on metadata-heavy ops like `VACUUM`.  

### ‚úÖ With This Solution  
- Only use OSS-compatible commands when outside Databricks.  
- Implement manual compaction/repartitioning for OSS.  
- Avoid Databricks-only SQL syntax in non-Databricks environments.  

## üß† Key Ideas to Remember  
- The **transaction log format** is shared; the **execution layer** is not.  
- Many Databricks Delta features are unavailable or incomplete in OSS Delta.  
- Expect different performance characteristics for the same commands.
